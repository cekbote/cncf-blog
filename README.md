# My Google Summer of Code Journey as a Student Developer for CoreDNS

*Guest post published by [Chanakya Ekbote](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chanakyaekbote/), a Google Summer of Code Student Developer, mentored by [Paul Greenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greenpau/) and [Yong Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yong-tang/) as a part of the CoreDNS Organisation. He is currently an underad at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar.*

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Through the program, students get matched with open source, free software and technology-related organizations to write code and contribute to the open source community. The organizations provide mentors who act as guides through the entire process, from learning about the community to contributing code. The selected students work on a 3 month programming project during their break from school. 

I was lucky and honoured to be selected to work on the project: [Anomaly Detection of the CoreDNS Server through Machine Learning](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4806808834670592) proposed by maintainers of the CoreDNS Organisation (a CNCF gradudated project). Through this post, I'd like to describe my journey and also showcase the work my mentors and I accomplished over the summer.

## General Overview

The project is currently being used to integrate machine learning capabilities with CoreDNS, with the objective of protecting people against malicious websites and applications. It helps in identifying websites that could be potentially used by malicious hackers and cybercriminals and prevents the user from accessing such websites. 

The project is also being used to provide machine learning capabilities to languages and platforms that generally have a dearth of such capabilities. One of the best features is that it is fully customisable and therefore can be tailored to fit the needs of any other project or organisation.
